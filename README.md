# xpkg

A simple cross-platform "package" manager.

## Overview

I tend to set up many aspects of my environment in a similar way, whether I'm on Linux, macOS, or some other unix-like.

As part of this, I have a whole grab-bag of scripts, configuration files, and the like, which I need to somehow download, install, and then quite often sym-link into various locations.

Previously I've done this by having a single git repo that I clone, and a bunch of scripts within it that I hook up to things like `.bashrc` in order to get everything working.

This isn't a very scalable solution, and I wanted something better.

Specifically I wanted to be able to:

- split the monolithic dump of tools and scripts into individual packages
- have each package live in a git repo
- easily install or remove a package
- have hooks automatically run when a package is installed, to set up symlinks etc
- have similar hooks run automatically to clean up when a package is removed

In a nutshell, that's what XPkg does.

## Installation

Running `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elegantchaos/XPkg/master/.bin/bootstrap | bash` should get you up and running.

What this does is:
- clone the project into `.local/share/xpkg`
- build it
- install some hooks to link it in to your path
- install a couple of essential packages


## Usage

To install a package from Github: `xpkg install <user/repo>`.

This will clone the package into a hidden location, then run any install scripts it finds in the manifest.

You can also specify a full repo URL if it's not on github.

To remove a package, `xpkg remove <package>`

To link an existing (local) directory as if it is a package: `xpkg link <package> <path>`.

For other commands, see `xpkg help`.

## Writing Packages

At their most basic, packages are just git repositories, which contain a payload (whatever files you want to install or hook into your system), plus a manifest (that tells XPkg how to install/uninstall the payload).

In the first iteration of XPkg, the manifest was a hidden json file called `.xpkg.json` which sat at the root of package and described sybolic links to create, and scripts to run, in order to do the installation.

This was lightweight, but a little inflexible. You could run code by invoking shell scripts, but you couldn't specify a requirement for other packages as dependencies, and the manifest syntax was a little bit gnarly.

In the current version of XPkg, package manifests are actually written in Swift. In fact, XPkg packages _are_ Swift Package Manager packages. When you install a package with XPkg, it uses the swift package manager to build and run a product with a special name (currently `xpkg-<your-package-name>`) in your package, passing it a known set of arguments and environment variables.

Your manifest product can do whatever it wants when it is run. There are some things that you commonly want to do (such as creating symbolic links to places like `/usr/local/bin`, running other scripts, etc). To make this simple, there is another Swift package called `XpkgPackage` which your package can import and use.

###Â Example

A simple package might consist of the following files:

    my-package/
      Package.swift
      Sources/xpkg-my-package/
        main.swift
      Payload/
        my-command.sh

The `Package.swift` file might look like this:

```Swift

// swift-tools-version:5.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "my-package",
    platforms: [
        .macOS(.v10_13)
    ],
    products: [
        .executable(name: "my-package-xpkg-hooks", targets: ["my-package-xpkg-hooks"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/elegantchaos/XPkgPackage", from:"1.0.5"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "my-package-xpkg-hooks",
            dependencies: ["XPkgPackage"]),
    ]
)
```

The `main.swift` file might look like this:

```Swift
import XPkgPackage

let links = [
    ["Payload/my-command.sh"]
]

let arguments = CommandLine.arguments
let package = InstalledPackage(fromCommandLine: arguments)
try! package.performAction(fromCommandLine: CommandLine.arguments, links: links, commands: [])
```

This uses the functionality provided by XPkgPackage to install a link `my-command` into `/usr/local/bin`, which points to the file `Payload/my-command.sh` in the cached version of the package on the disk.


## Future Plans

There are lots of things not done / not working. right now.

Some planned improvements:

- updating packages (using git pull)
- specifying versions of package
- installing multiple packages at once (a la npm/bundle/brew/etc)
- bootstrapping the install of xpkg
- updating xpkg
